# 100 Days Of Code - Log (2nd run)

## Day 5: 2018-04-06

**Today's Progress:** Until I figure out the abstraction I want to implement for the Rest requests, I wanted to try out the Cinema City API itself. I managed to get some work done, but I messed up an extension function, which was meant to replace "path params" in a string (like {{0}}). So will finish it tomorrow! I also looked into how to approach testing in Kotlin, and I found a [great article](https://blog.philipphauer.de/best-practices-unit-testing-kotlin/) by Philipp Hauer.

**Thoughts:** I found out that it's sometimes easier to rather keep coding for a while and try to improve small things before starting a bigger task, just to warm you up, and give some time to think and get inspiration for the upcoming bigger work.

## Day 4: 2018-04-05

**Today's Progress:** I use awesome [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/Fuel) Kotlin lib for my HTTP requests - however I find it a little low level for my needs, so I started to build a wrapper around it - to suit my special needs (path params), and for awesome dependency inversion and abstraction. No commits today though, because it's unfinished atm. Maybe I could also go with extension functions?

**Thoughts:** It was a little late when I opened up IntelliJ, but I did not regret it. Even if squeezing a little work in, you can get into the flow rather quickly if you have a plan what you want to accomplish.

## Day 3: 2018-04-04

**Today's Progress:** I worked on PupperBot again. I had some errands to do today so I only had time to refine some domain models for the cinema API and delete some ded code. I also had some regex practice!

**Thoughts:** Although I did not make incredible progress, I managed to learn some new regex trix, also had time to think about how I'll approach the abstraction of the Cinema City API layer.

## Day 2: 2018-04-03

**Today's Progress:** I started implementing the new Cinema functionality into PupperBot. I'm trying to apply SOLID principles more this time, while also trying to still keep it simple (stupid).

**Thoughts:** I'm stoked - I think I made good progress. I want to finish this functionality by end of the week, hopefully I can show something by then. The eventual goal is to show movie schedules from Cinema City cinemas from any city in a nice embed. I also might implement some "commands by reactions" functionality for it - it should be interesting!

## Day 1: 2018-04-01

**Today's Progress:** I just updated some dependencies for my pupperbot-discord project, to prepare for some work tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at it again - I'll motivated to try the 100DaysOfCode challange again - I think the most important lesson I've learnt from last time is that I should not overcommit to this challenge to the point it becomes cumbersome and burnout-heavy, I'll do it little by little.
