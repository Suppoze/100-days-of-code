# 100 Days Of Code - Log (2nd run)

## Day 2: 2018-04-03

**Today's Progress:** I started implementing the new Cinema functionality into PupperBot. I'm trying to apply SOLID principles more this time, while also trying to still keep it simple (stupid).

**Thoughts:** I'm stoked - I think I made good progress. I want to finish this functionality by end of the week, hopefully I can show something by then. The eventual goal is to show movie schedules from Cinema City cinemas from any city in a nice embed. I also might implement some "commands by reactions" functionality for it - it should be interesting!

## Day 1: 2018-04-01

**Today's Progress:** I just updated some dependencies for my pupperbot-discord project, to prepare for some work tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at it again - I'll motivated to try the 100DaysOfCode challange again - I think the most important lesson I've learnt from last time is that I should not overcommit to this challenge to the point it becomes cumbersome and burnout-heavy, I'll do it little by little.
