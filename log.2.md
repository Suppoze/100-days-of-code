# 100 Days Of Code - Log (2nd run)

## Day 1: 2018-04-01

**Today's Progress:** I just updated some dependencies for my pupperbot-discord project, to prepare for some work tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at it again - I'll motivated to try the 100DaysOfCode challange again - I think the most important lesson I've learnt from last time is that I should not overcommit to this challenge to the point it becomes cumbersome and burnout-heavy, I'll do it little by little.
