# 100 Days Of Code - Log (3rd run)

## Day 2: 2019-11-14

**Today's Progress:** Tried to implement scaling of the gems on mouse enter and mouse exit. Unfortunately I did not quite get it...

**Thoughts:** Last couple of days were busy, so I could not spend time with the challange. But I'm always happy when I can sit down a little, even for a little brainstorm!

**Today's Progress:** Implemented a basic board generation script.

**Thoughts:** Progress feels good! I'm not really satisfied with the gems though, I think the they should be more generic, and not each of them should be a separate prefab.

**Today's Progress:** I want to play with Unity again... I have an idea for a match 3 game with a twist. I downloaded the alpha for Unity 2020.1, grabbed some free assets and started the project today! Wish me luck!

**Thoughts:** Feeling excited!
