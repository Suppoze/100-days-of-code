**Today's Progress:** Managed to get the scaling of the gems to work, and also started the gem dragging logic. I have some good ideas on how to continue with the movement of other gems as well!

**Materials:** I also watched [Ryan Hipple's amazing talk about game architecture using ScriptableObjects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk) which I highly recommend. It was eye opening and really made me think on how to structure my game.

## Day 4: 2019-11-22

**Today's Progress:** Ditched the scaling for a bit, instead I'm trying to implement a generic data structure for the gems, so that I don't need a prefab for every gem color (and behaviour) later. Trying ScriptableObjects, but not sure it is what I need.

## Day 3: 2019-11-20

**Today's Progress:** Tried to implement scaling of the gems on mouse enter and mouse exit. Unfortunately I did not quite get it...

**Thoughts:** Last couple of days were busy, so I could not spend time with the challange. But I'm always happy when I can sit down a little, even for a little brainstorm!

## Day 2: 2019-11-14

**Today's Progress:** Implemented a basic board generation script.

**Thoughts:** Progress feels good! I'm not really satisfied with the gems though, I think the they should be more generic, and not each of them should be a separate prefab.

**Today's Progress:** I want to play with Unity again... I have an idea for a match 3 game with a twist. I downloaded the alpha for Unity 2020.1, grabbed some free assets and started the project today! Wish me luck!

**Thoughts:** Feeling excited!
