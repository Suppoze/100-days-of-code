**Today's Progress:** Implemented a basic board generation script.

**Thoughts:** Progress feels good! I'm not really satisfied with the gems though, I think the they should be more generic, and not each of them should be a separate prefab.

**Today's Progress:** I want to play with Unity again... I have an idea for a match 3 game with a twist. I downloaded the alpha for Unity 2020.1, grabbed some free assets and started the project today! Wish me luck!

**Thoughts:** Feeling excited!
