# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a good 2-3 hours to fix a coordinate normalization problem I noticed: the nodes where not scaled properly on one axis.

**Thoughts:** I already had a serious project going on, namely my thesis which should be finished soon. So I decided to go back to it after a long hiatus. It's supposed to be a geocaching game when it's done (or something like that).

### Day 2: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Sadly, Unity refused to build a working version of the app today, I am still investigating what is causing the problem. Other than that, I tried to tweak the coordinate normalization further.

**Thoughts:** I think I made a serious issue while working with the nodes gotten from OpenStreetMap, because the generated map is still slightly deformed, doesn't matter how I approach it. Might be a rounding problem, which if it is, I need to dig deeper. Anyways, I will work on something more fun part of this project tomorrow.
