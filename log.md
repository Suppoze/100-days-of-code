# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still had some issues with Unity versions, but in the end, I managed to restore a working project. This took a sizable amount of time, but I could spend some time with upgrading the visuals a little, I also added some status messages.

**Thoughts:** I am relieved that I can finally leave this problem behind, seems like I can focus on more fun parts of the project in the future.

### Day 3: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Successfully identified the problem which was causing builds to crash on Android: it was related to Unity's location service. As it turns out, [it is a bug in Unity 's implementation itself!](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-location-app-crashes-due-to-error-jstring-has-wrong-type-android-dot-location-dot-location). Luckily, the initial commit I made on GitHub was with a working version.

**Thoughts:** This day was a huge bummer but also a big relief. This crash really demotivated me, so that's why I went on a 3-4 day hiatus from #100DaysOfCode. But now I feel I can make progress again from tomorrow!

### Day 2: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Sadly, Unity refused to build a working version of the app today, I am still investigating what is causing the problem. Other than that, I tried to tweak the coordinate normalization further.

**Thoughts:** I think I made a serious issue while working with the nodes gotten from OpenStreetMap, because the generated map is still slightly deformed, doesn't matter how I approach it. Might be a rounding problem, which if it is, I need to dig deeper. Anyways, I will work on something more fun part of this project tomorrow.

### Day 1: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a good 2-3 hours to fix a coordinate normalization problem I noticed: the nodes where not scaled properly on one axis.

**Thoughts:** I already had a serious project going on, namely my thesis which should be finished soon. So I decided to go back to it after a long hiatus. It's supposed to be a geocaching game when it's done (or something like that).
