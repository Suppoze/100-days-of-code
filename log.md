# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a good 2-3 hours to fix a coordinate normalization problem I noticed: the nodes where not scaled properly on one axis.

**Thoughts:** I already had a serious project going on, namely my thesis which should be finished soon. So I decided to go back to it after a long hiatus. It's supposed to be a geocaching game when it's done (or something like that).
